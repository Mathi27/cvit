        <h1>Species Eradication Alert!</h1>
        <p class="highlight">Last fifty Kanchi Bulls alone left in our Planet.</p>
        <div class="image-container">

        <p>India has over 175 Varieties of Cows. Tamil Nadu alone has over 45 varieties.</p>
        <p>Kanchi Bull and Cow is one among them.</p>
        <p>If a cow sees a bull from another breed come behind it, the cow will immediately sit down. Why? Else if mating happens, the cow will die in delivering the mixed breed calf (head shape, leg shape, etc). Cows are sensitive to breeds, therefore transporting breeds and caging them in restricted spaces is extremely wrong.</p>
        <p>Jerseys are brought into this country to serve the famines. Milk + Coffee. They are not Indian Breed Cows (Not Gaumatha). Our Bulls and Cows have been stolen to America - called American Brahman <a href="https://brahman.org/" target="_blank">https://brahman.org/</a></p>
        <p>We have seen - At just 150 Rs/KG, our Kanchi Bulls have been wiped away this whole year. Only 50 Kanchi Bulls are left now.</p>
        <p>This is a very serious species alert.</p>
        <p>Artificial Insemination and Semen extraction is not the way to protect and extend the life of any species on this planet. Definitely not our Gaumatha.</p>
        <p>We have found a solution. 1 Kanchi Bull + 10 Kanchi Cows in 1 acre of land can begin their self-sustained life. (13 Countries are importing natural Cow dung from our Indian Breed Cows)</p>
        <p>Fodder + Natural Vegetables + Farming + Cow Products + Care taking family. The entire family will save this Go-tram at 50,000/- per bull + herd. And another 50,000 to set up the care taking, until self-sustenance comes about.</p>
        <p>Please contribute to our The Children of Indus Valley Trust. We will arrange for the Bulls to be transported with cows, Gaupooja would be done across all Gaushalas where we save this Go-tram, and daily updates shared with you by WhatsApp.</p>
